# :headphones: City Music Project
In this project, I compared the musical preferences of the residents of two cities, Springfild and Shelbyville. 
I examined actual data from Y.Music to test the hypotheses below and compare the behaviors of users from these two cities.

## :scroll: Overview

In this project i am going to check the follow hypotheses: 
1. User activity differs depending on the day of the week and the city.
2. During Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday nights.
3. Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have different preferences. In Springfield, people prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.

Column Descriptions:
- `userID` — user identifier
- `Track` — track title
- `artist` — artist name
- `genre` — music genre
- `City` — user's city
- `time` — the exact time the track was played
- `Day` — day of the week
